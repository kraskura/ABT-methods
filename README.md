# ABT-methods

Breakpoint methods: 

_The breakpoint at which the incremental increase in individual fish fHmax changed rates was estimated on regression ln(ƒHmax) ~ 1000/Temperature (in Kelvin) using the segmented function in R (package ‘segmented’105) with parametric bootstrap (n = 100 boot samples). The breakpoint estimate was not included when: i) the confidence interval of the estimated breakpoint exceeded ± 1.5ºC (n = 2), ii) the breakpoint was not statistically identified (n = 1). _
